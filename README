Notes on the project:
- messaging between server and client works but we had trouble implementing the forwarding to the rest of the clients
- we store the clients in a linked list, but can't send them to clients due to above issue.
- we created an interface for listing users via "/list" command that client would type in, but doesn't execute the command due to not being able to get list from server.
- terminating with CTRL-C works
- couldn't get select to branch 3 way?
